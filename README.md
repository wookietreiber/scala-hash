Scala Hash
==========

Scala Hash is a Scala library for checksums, cyclic redundancy checks, non-cryptographic hash
functions and cryptographic hash functions.

I don't know yet what the most Scala-idiomatic ways are to work with these kinds of functions, so
feel free to open issues and pull requests or yell at me if you think of a better one. But, I guess,
there is *more than one* idiomatic way, depending one what you are working with - Stream, Monoid,
Iteratee, ...
